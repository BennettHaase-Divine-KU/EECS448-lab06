Bugs:

-isEmpty() always returns true
-addBack() adds elements in inncorent way (adds to the front)
-removeBack() and removeFront() cannot work as intended due to isEmpty always returning true i.e, it always belives the list is empty and will not remove anything

--------------------

Working as inteneded:
these methods are working as intended
-size()
-search()
-toVector()
-addFront()
